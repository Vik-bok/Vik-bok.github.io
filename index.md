# Welcome to My Portfolio ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I'm Vhyck Aquino (Vik), a passionate developer and designer.

## About Me
Hey, Iâ€™m Vhyck Aquino (Vik)! Iâ€™m currently studying **Computer Programming** at **Humber College**, where I get to dive into coding and problem-solving every day. I love the hands-on experience Iâ€™m getting through my courses and projects. Itâ€™s all about practicing those problem-solving skills, getting better at debugging, and really thinking through how to make things work.

When I'm not coding, Iâ€™m also into layout design and making sure the projects I build not only function well but look great too. I like to create user-friendly designs that are clean, simple, and easy to navigate. Iâ€™m always pushing myself to get better, whether itâ€™s through class assignments or personal projects.

### Skills
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Problem Solving**: Debugging, optimization, and critical thinking
- **Design**: UI/UX design, layout creation
